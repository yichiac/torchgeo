This directory contains several files that document the versions of our dependencies used in CI. These are not hard requirements for using TorchGeo.

### Managed by dependabot

All files with a `.txt` extension are managed by dependabot and should not be manually edited unless you need to add or remove a dependency.

### Not managed by dependabot

All files with a `.old` extension are not managed by dependabot. They document the minimum version of our dependencies that we support. See [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/) for more information on the Scientific Python ecosystem deprecation timeline. See https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/5299 and https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/5300 for why these dependencies have to be in separate files with a different file extension.
